# Development Best Practices

  context: "Global development guidelines for Agent OS projects"

  updated: "2025-08-06"
```

## Core Principles

```yaml
core_principles:
  context_check:
    implementation: |
      # Check if Core Principles already loaded
      if [ "$CORE_PRINCIPLES_LOADED" = "true" ]; then
        echo "Using Core Principles already in context"
      else
        echo "Loading Core Principles..."
        CORE_PRINCIPLES_LOADED=true
      fi
  
  principles:
    - id: keep_it_simple
      name: "Keep It Simple"
      guidelines:
        - "Implement code in the fewest lines possible"
        - "Avoid over-engineering solutions"
        - "Choose straightforward approaches over clever ones"
      priority: high
    
    - id: optimize_for_readability
      name: "Optimize for Readability"
      guidelines:
        - "Prioritize code clarity over micro-optimizations"
        - "Write self-documenting code with clear variable names"
        - "Add comments for \"why\" not \"what\""
      priority: high
    
    - id: dry
      name: "DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)"
      guidelines:
        - "Extract repeated business logic to private methods"
        - "Extract repeated UI markup to reusable components"
        - "Create utility functions for common operations"
      priority: medium
    
    - id: file_structure
      name: "File Structure"
      guidelines:
        - "Keep files focused on a single responsibility"
        - "Group related functionality together"
        - "Use consistent naming conventions"
      priority: medium
```

## Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  context_check:
    implementation: |
      # Check if task involves choosing an external library
      if [ "$TASK_TYPE" = "choosing-external-library" ]; then
        if [ "$DEPENDENCIES_LOADED" = "true" ]; then
          echo "Using Dependencies guidelines already in context"
        else
          echo "Loading Dependencies guidelines..."
          DEPENDENCIES_LOADED=true
        fi
      fi
  
  guidelines:
    - id: choose_libraries_wisely
      name: "Choose Libraries Wisely"
      description: "When adding third-party dependencies"
      criteria:
        - "Select the most popular and actively maintained option"
        - "Check the library's GitHub repository for:"
        - "  - Recent commits (within last 6 months)"
        - "  - Active issue resolution"
        - "  - Number of stars/downloads"
        - "  - Clear documentation"
      priority: high
```

## Testing Practices

```yaml
testing:
  general_guidelines:
    - "Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)"
    - "Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details"
    - "Ensure test names clearly describe what is being tested"
    - "Test both success and failure scenarios"
  
  test_types:
    - id: unit_tests
      description: "Test individual functions and classes in isolation"
      coverage_target: "90% of business logic"
      
    - id: integration_tests
      description: "Test interactions between components"
      coverage_target: "Key user flows and system boundaries"
      
    - id: e2e_tests
      description: "Test complete user flows"
      coverage_target: "Critical business processes"
```

## Performance Guidelines

```yaml
performance:
  - id: early_optimization
    guideline: "Avoid premature optimization"
    explanation: "Focus on making it work correctly first, then optimize if necessary"
    
  - id: resource_management
    guideline: "Be mindful of resource usage"
    examples:
      - "Clean up after operations (close files, release connections)"
      - "Dispose of large objects when no longer needed"
      - "Be careful with memory-intensive operations"
    
  - id: async_operations
    guideline: "Use asynchronous operations for I/O-bound work"
    examples:
      - "Network requests should be async"
      - "File operations should be async"
      - "Database operations should be async"
```

## Security Best Practices

```yaml
security:
  - id: input_validation
    guideline: "Validate all user input"
    explanation: "Never trust user input; always validate before processing"
    
  - id: authentication
    guideline: "Implement proper authentication"
    requirements:
      - "Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)"
      - "Implement proper session management"
      - "Use secure defaults for auth libraries"
    
  - id: authorization
    guideline: "Implement proper authorization"
    requirements:
      - "Check permissions on all protected resources"
      - "Implement role-based access control where appropriate"
      - "Never rely on security by obscurity"
    
  - id: sensitive_data
    guideline: "Protect sensitive data"
    requirements:
      - "Encrypt sensitive data at rest"
      - "Use HTTPS for all communications"
      - "Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, PII)"
```
