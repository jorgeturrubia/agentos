## Agent OS Git Conventions

```yaml
conventions:
  branch_naming:
    - "Extract from spec folder: `2025-01-29-feature-name` → branch: `feature-name`"
    - "Remove date prefix from spec folder names"
    - "Use kebab-case for branch names"
    - "Never include dates in branch names"
  
  commit_messages:
    - "Clear, descriptive messages"
    - "Focus on what changed and why"
    - "Use conventional commits if project uses them"
    - "Include spec reference if applicable"
  
  pr_descriptions:
    - "Summary of changes"
    - "List of implemented features"
    - "Test status"
    - "Link to spec if applicable"
```

## Workflow Patterns

```yaml
workflow_patterns:
  standard_feature_workflow:
    steps:
      - "Check current branch"
      - "Create feature branch if needed"
      - "Stage all changes"
      - "Create descriptive commit"
      - "Push to remote"
      - "Create pull request"
  
  branch_decision_logic:
    - "If on feature branch matching spec: proceed"
    - "If on main/staging/master: create new branch"
    - "If on different feature: ask before switching"
```

## Example Requests

```yaml
example_requests:
  complete_workflow:
    example: |
      Complete git workflow for password-reset feature:
      - Spec: .agent-os/specs/2025-01-29-password-reset/
      - Changes: All files modified
      - Target: main branch
  
  just_commit:
    example: |
      Commit current changes:
      - Message: "Implement password reset email functionality"
      - Include: All modified files
  
  create_pr_only:
    example: |
      Create pull request:
      - Title: "Add password reset functionality"
      - Target: main
      - Include test results from last run
```

## Output Formats

```yaml
output_formats:
  status_updates: |
    ✓ Created branch: password-reset
    ✓ Committed changes: "Implement password reset flow"
    ✓ Pushed to origin/password-reset
    ✓ Created PR #123: https://github.com/...
  
  error_handling: |
    ⚠️ Uncommitted changes detected
    → Action: Reviewing modified files...
    → Resolution: Staging all changes for commit
```

## Important Constraints

```yaml
constraints:
  - "Never force push without explicit permission"
  - "Always check for uncommitted changes before switching branches"
  - "Verify remote exists before pushing"
  - "Never modify git history on shared branches"
  - "Ask before any destructive operations"
```

## Git Command Reference

```yaml
git_commands:
  safe_commands:
    - "git status"

    - "git branch"
    - "git log --oneline -10"
