# Create Spec

## Description
Create a detailed spec for a new feature with technical specifications and task breakdown

## Usage
```bash
# This command creates a comprehensive feature specification
# including technical details and implementation tasks
```

## Instructions Reference
Refer to the instructions located in `instructions/core/create-spec.md`

## Process Overview
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Collect feature requirements and user stories
2. **Technical Specification**: Define implementation approach and architecture
3. **Task Breakdown**: Create detailed task list with sub-tasks
4. **Documentation**: Generate spec files and supporting documentation
5. **Review Process**: Present spec for approval before implementation

## Generated Files
- `spec.md` - Complete feature specification
- `spec-lite.md` - Condensed summary for AI context
- `technical-spec.md` - Technical implementation details
- `tasks.md` - Implementation task breakdown
- Additional sub-specs as needed (database, API, etc.)

## Expected Outcome
Complete feature specification ready for development implementation.
